# GPT-Math-Wolfram-Alpha-API

This repository is a Node.js wrapper for the Wolfram Alpha API. It is specifically designed for creating custom GPT Actions.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/GPT-Math-Wolfram-Alpha-API.git
  ```

2. Install the dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

3. Set up your Wolfram Alpha API credentials. You can obtain the API credentials by signing up on the [Wolfram Alpha Developer Portal](https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/myapps/).

4. Update the `.env` file with your API credentials:

  ```plaintext
  WOLFRAM_ALPHA_APP_ID=your-app-id
  ```

5. Start the application:

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

## Usage
